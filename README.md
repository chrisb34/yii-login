Yii Login and register

A very basic but working model for Yii databse authentication.  It includes:
- A user table
- Registration form
- Activation by email
- Forgotten password link
- Sign-in
- Change password function once signed in
- Password strength algorithm
- Standard Yii login with captcha

This is not "industrial strength" but intended as a starting point for your Yii User Authentication requirements.

Consider feeding back your enhancements.

based on Yii 1.1.14
